# Visual Question Answering

# Introduction

- Visual Question Answering comes with the potential to solve a plethora of real world problems.
- The ability to decode images and answer questions based on their elements is fascinating. A few examples could be - analysis of reports, knowledge bank, question answering engine, and so forth. 
- With the advent of deep learning, these seemingly intricate tasks have now become a possibility. 
- In this project, we aspire to build models that help us build a visual question answering system.

# Usage Steps


# Models 
- In this project, we experiment by implementing 4 models. 
- Our motivation to do so was to try and understand the effect of CNN based models, RNNs such as LSTMs and GRUs along with attention mechanisms on the various VQA tasks.
